The survey result is comprised of statistics on survey responses from students, parents, and teachers, and the survey could be a important tool in understanding the current education status quo from three perspectives and multiple aspects. Examples of survey administered to parents and students in year 2019, which is the year of our project data: https://https://infohub.nyced.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/parent-survey_1015.pdf https://infohub.nyced.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/student-survey_1010.pdf 1.2 Our goal in this project Interested in how things could be quantified in social sciences, we thought the dataset could provide us with some interesting insights into the use of data science in education. Additionally, we noticed that the survey is distributed annually, and the data is collected from multiple perspectives. Thus, the survey data could be an insightful instrument in summarizing the current status quo of education and in promoting improvements in education. In general, we thought it’s an interesting dataset in helping us to explore the interdisciplinarity of data science while learning more about the education actuality in New York City. By looking into the NYC School Quality Reports that reflect the opinion of parents, teachers and students, we wish to be able to answer the questions listed below: What are the top 10 schools with the highest survey performance? What are their characteristics? What is the distribution of performance over the six components (Collaborative Teachers Score, Effective School Leadership Score, Rigorous Instruction Score, Supportive Environment Score, Strong Family Community Ties Score, Trust Score)? What does it imply? How do parents, teachers, and students rate the education experience respectively? Do teachers and students have a consensus on their survey scores? And what about the relationship between students’ and parents’ responses?

As shown in the FAQ document of the NYC School Survey, the survey is voluntary and all District 75 students are provided with survey materials. All participants (parents, students, and teachers) involved are confidential, while only the teachers’ responses are both anonymous and confidential. While the surveys may be completed online or by paper by parents and students, teachers are only allowed to take the survey online. More info on this link: https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/school-quality/nyc-school-survey/survey-archives The result of parent, teacher, and student responses of the NYC school survey can be found in the links listed below: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2019-NYC-School-Survey-Teachers/uzmq-2khh https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2019-NYC-School-Survey-Parents/4fcz-jias https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2019-NYC-School-Survey-Student/k2zg-756q We download the dataset as xlsx format from the aforementioned websites. 2.2 A glimpse at our dataset 2.2.1 Dataframe on Aggregated Data The survey contains a aggregated dataframe in which scores evaluating different dimensions of school performance are calculated based on students, teachers, and parents’ responses. 2.2.1.1 Meanings of columns Before we start to perform any exploratory data analysis and visualization, we need to understand what does each column mean in our dataset. The three dataframes we mentioned above – Student, Teacher and Parent survey result – contains 11 columns: DBN: Primary key for the dataset and identification of schools. School Name: School Name Total Parent/Teacher/Student Response Rate: Percentage rate of response from parent/teacher/student respectively Collaborative Teachers Score Effective School Leadership Score Rigorous Instruction Score Supportive Environment Score Strong Family-Community Ties Score Trust Score Despite the aggregated dataframe should be exactly the same for all three datasets, it is different within each dataset The exact information on this dataframe from each dataset is displayed below. In summary, we concluded that the aggregated dataframe of teacher and parents’ consists of DBNs where evaluation scores are completely void. Thus, we decide to look into the aggregated dataframe provided in the student response dataset. 2.2.1.2 Student Reponse dataset The student response result is a dataframe with 1831 observations and 11 columns. As the first two rows of the dataframe is completely empty, the dataset actually consists of 1829 observations. Some important information are shown below: ## tibble [1,831 × 11] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ DBN : chr [1:1831] NA NA &quot;01M015&quot; &quot;01M019&quot; ... ## $ School Name : chr [1:1831] NA NA &quot;P.S. 015 ROBERTO CLEMENTE&quot; &quot;P.S. 019 ASHER LEVY&quot; ... ## $ Total Parent ## Response Rate : num [1:1831] NA NA 91 100 58 29 80 52 79 46 ... ## $ Total Teacher Response Rate : num [1:1831] NA NA 100 93 90 100 100 96 77 93 ... ## $ Total Student Response Rate : chr [1:1831] NA NA &quot;N/A&quot; &quot;N/A&quot; ... ## $ Collaborative Teachers Score : chr [1:1831] NA NA &quot;4.0999999999999996&quot; &quot;4.53&quot; ... ## $ Effective School Leadership Score : chr [1:1831] NA NA &quot;4.1900000000000004&quot; &quot;4.51&quot; ... ## $ Rigorous Instruction Score : chr [1:1831] NA NA &quot;4.0199999999999996&quot; &quot;4.8&quot; ... ## $ Supportive Environment Score : chr [1:1831] NA NA &quot;N/A&quot; &quot;N/A&quot; ... ## $ Strong Family-Community Ties Score: chr [1:1831] NA NA &quot;4.18&quot; &quot;4.66&quot; ... ## $ Trust Score : chr [1:1831] NA NA &quot;3.96&quot; &quot;3.76&quot; ... 2.2.1.3 Teacher Reponse dataset Similarly, the teacher response result is a dataframe of 1,903 observations and 11 columns.

Currently, each dataframe has questions as the column name, while the answer choices falls into the first row. Additionally, as each question may take up to five or six columns, there are hundreds of variables within each dataframe. Thus, after data cleaning, we have made choices to focus on some specific categories within each dataframes. 2.2.2.1 Student Reponse dataset Student Reponse dataset is a dataframe of 1,111 observations and 272 columns. The actual observations should be 1109, as the first two rows are not comprised of statistics on survey response.

While the survey responses are categorical, the aggregated dataframe consists of numerical values calculated based on these survey response. We did not obtain specific information on how these numerical values are calculated, thus our analysis is primarily based on the dataframes of specific survey responses. In order to conduct the analysis, we have cleaned and wrangled the dataframes on specific survey questions based on our own understanding which could be subjective and biased.

The original dataframe contains survey questions as the column names. After loading the data in r, the answer choices is read as values in the first row. Thus, we have combined the answer choices within the column name for data wrangling and for the uniqueness of column names. Additionally, for the convenience of data wrangling, we have replaced the survey questions to question index in the column names. Additionally, the data types of many columns are incorrect – instead of character, they should be float. Therefore, we convert the data type of those columns to numeric. A example of students’ response after data wrangling: ## # A tibble: 6 × 272 ## DBN `School Name` student_rr `1a-s_disagree` `1a-disagree` `1a-agree` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 01M034 P.S. 034 FRANKLIN … 95 11 23 45 ## 2 01M140 P.S. 140 NATHAN ST… 87 14 47 63 ## 3 01M184 P.S. 184M SHUANG W… 100 24 59 125 ## 4 01M188 P.S. 188 THE ISLAN… 66 0 0 7 ## 5 01M292 ORCHARD COLLEGIATE… 82 5 24 75 ## 6 01M332 UNIVERSITY NEIGHBO… 92 5 21 111 ## # … with 266 more variables: 1a-s_agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1a-idk &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # 1b-s_disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1b-disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1b-agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1b-s_agree &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # 1b-idk &lt;dbl&gt;, 1c-s_disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1c-disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1c-agree &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # 1c-s_agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1c-idk &lt;dbl&gt;, 1d-s_disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1d-disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # 1d-agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1d-s_agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1d-idk &lt;dbl&gt;, 1e-s_disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # 1e-disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1e-agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1e-s_agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1e-idk &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # 1f-s_disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1f-disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1f-agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1f-s_agree &lt;dbl&gt;, … A example of parents’ response after data wrangling: ## # A tibble: 6 × 196 ## DBN `School Name` parent_rr `1a-s_disagree` `1a-disagree` `1a-agree` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 01M015 P.S. 015 ROBERTO CL… 91 2 4 52 ## 2 01M019 P.S. 019 ASHER LEVY 100 3 1 112 ## 3 01M020 P.S. 020 ANNA SILVER 58 4 13 119 ## 4 01M034 P.S. 034 FRANKLIN D… 29 1 5 27 ## 5 01M063 THE STAR ACADEMY - … 80 3 8 63 ## 6 01M064 P.S. 064 ROBERT SIM… 52 2 2 42 ## # … with 190 more variables: 1a-s_agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1b-s_disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # 1b-disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1b-agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1b-s_agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1c-s_disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # 1c-disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1c-agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1c-s_agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1d-s_disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # 1d-disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1d-agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1d-s_agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1e-s_disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # 1e-disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1e-agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1e-s_agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1f-s_disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # 1f-disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1f-agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1f-s_agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1g-s_disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # 1g-disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1g-agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1g-s_agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 1h-s_disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, … A example of teachers’ response after data wrangling: ## # A tibble: 6 × 579 ## DBN `School Name` teacher_rr `1a-none` `1a-some` `1a-a_lot` `1a-all` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 01M015 P.S. 015 ROBERTO CL… 100 0 3 14 11 ## 2 01M019 P.S. 019 ASHER LEVY 93 0 9 17 10 ## 3 01M020 P.S. 020 ANNA SILVER 90 1 13 19 4 ## 4 01M034 P.S. 034 FRANKLIN D… 100 2 14 9 12 ## 5 01M063 THE STAR ACADEMY - … 100 0 12 11 2 ## 6 01M064 P.S. 064 ROBERT SIM… 96 0 1 8 15 ## # … with 572 more variables: 1b-none &lt;dbl&gt;, 1b-some &lt;dbl&gt;, 1b-a_lot &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # 1b-all &lt;dbl&gt;, 1c-none &lt;dbl&gt;, 1c-some &lt;dbl&gt;, 1c-a_lot &lt;dbl&gt;, 1c-all &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # 1d-none &lt;dbl&gt;, 1d-some &lt;dbl&gt;, 1d-a_lot &lt;dbl&gt;, 1d-all &lt;dbl&gt;, 1e-none &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # 1e-some &lt;dbl&gt;, 1e-a_lot &lt;dbl&gt;, 1e-all &lt;dbl&gt;, 2a-s_disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # 2a-disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, 2a-agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 2a-s_agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 2a-idk &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # 2b-s_disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, 2b-disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, 2b-agree &lt;dbl&gt;, 2b-s_agree &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # 2b-idk &lt;dbl&gt;, 2c-s_disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, 2c-disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, 2c-agree &lt;dbl&gt;, … 3.3 Step 3: Categorizing data based on survey questions The survey questions included in this survey is comprehensive and difficult to manage. After reading through our survey questions, based on the survey questions, we have decided to categorize the data into different categories, and choose to analyze several categories based on our interests and whether there is sufficient data support. We realized that categorizing data based on survey questions could be highly objective and admit it as a limitation. We are open to any discussions and advice on categorizing survey questions. Several questions are directly removed during the categorizing process. We have removed question 3, 4b, 4h, 14, 15, 16, 24, 25 from the teacher’s survey either because it’s not particularly relevant to survey questions from students’ and parents’ perspective, or due to significant amount of NAs. Questions 5d, 5e, 7, 8, 9, 10 are removed from the parents’ dataset due to similar reasons or because some questions are targeted towards specific populations (eg. pre-k, high school). Some questions may be removed in latter process due to the inconsistencies in answer choices under the same category of questions. For example, while both question a and b falls under the same category, question a may have five answer choices while question b only have four answer choices. After discussion, here are some example of the aspects we have decided to look into are teaching quality (from all perspectives of students, parents, and teachers), student performance (based on the feedback of teachers), communication between school and family (mainly based on the response from parents and teachers), and lastly, we’ll look into the characteristics that may contribute to teaching quality, for example, trust and respect between teachers. 3.4 Step 4: Datasets that we decide to analyze Note that some answer choice are renamed due to inconsistencies between questions. Additionally, some questions are deleted due to the same reason. 3.4.1 Communication with families from teachers’ and parents’ perspectives ## # A tibble: 6 × 13 ## DBN `School Name` teacher_rr t_s_disagree t_s_agree t_agree t_disagree ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 01M015 P.S. 015 ROBERTO … 100 1 85 235 2 ## 2 01M019 P.S. 019 ASHER LE… 93 2 95 284 7 ## 3 01M020 P.S. 020 ANNA SIL… 90 1 79 270 10 ## 4 01M034 P.S. 034 FRANKLIN… 100 10 83 275 41 ## 5 01M063 THE STAR ACADEMY … 100 0 65 190 6 ## 6 01M064 P.S. 064 ROBERT S… 96 2 83 205 9 ## # … with 6 more variables: parent_rr &lt;dbl&gt;, p_s_disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # p_s_agree &lt;dbl&gt;, p_agree &lt;dbl&gt;, p_disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, p_idk &lt;dbl&gt; 3.4.2 Teaching quality and student performance ## # A tibble: 6 × 19 ## DBN `School Name` parent_rr p_v_neagtive p_negative p_positive p_v_positive ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 01M034 P.S. 034 FRA… 29 1 5 130 59 ## 2 01M140 P.S. 140 NAT… 57 5 16 331 174 ## 3 01M184 P.S. 184M SH… 92 5 50 928 385 ## 4 01M188 P.S. 188 THE… 99 2 3 513 198 ## 5 01M292 ORCHARD COLL… 49 6 10 163 71 ## 6 01M332 UNIVERSITY N… 76 4 23 285 124 ## # … with 12 more variables: p_idk &lt;dbl&gt;, teacher_rr &lt;dbl&gt;, t_NAs &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # t_v_negative &lt;dbl&gt;, t_v_positive &lt;dbl&gt;, t_positive &lt;dbl&gt;, t_negative &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # student_rr &lt;dbl&gt;, st_v_negative &lt;dbl&gt;, st_v_positive &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # st_positive &lt;dbl&gt;, st_negative &lt;dbl&gt; ## # A tibble: 6 × 8 ## DBN `School Name` teacher_rr t_none t_some t_lot t_all t_idk ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 01M015 P.S. 015 ROBERTO CLEMENTE 100 5 87 150 66 0 ## 2 01M019 P.S. 019 ASHER LEVY 93 2 112 212 89 0 ## 3 01M020 P.S. 020 ANNA SILVER 90 18 150 222 26 2 ## 4 01M034 P.S. 034 FRANKLIN D.

In most cases, the dataset is only missing the variable Supportive Environment Score. The variable is also the one with most missing values: in fact, with 1829 missing observations, this variable is completely missing, which indicates this score might not be measured during the year of 2019. Therefore, there is no complete cases in this dataset as we know that one variable is completely void. However, more than 1/2 of the data only have the Supportive Environment Score missing. Besides Supportive Environment Score, Total Student Response Rate has the second most NAs, with 720 observations. As we can observe from this graph, missing Supportive Environment Score and Total Student Response Rate are the two most common missing patterns of the dataset, around 80% to 90% of the data lies in this category. Five other variables with missing values are: Collaborative Teachers, Effective School Leadership, Family-Community Ties', 'Rigorous Instructions, and Trust. Besides Trust, the number of missing values for the other four variables are roughly equal, with around 200 missing values, while Trust has only 72 missing values. It made sense that the amount of missing values in different aspects are similar as these variables are calculated based on survey reponses. As we’ve discussed earlier, this dataset does not contains complete cases, which means for certain observations all variables do not contain NAs. However, we can see that the columns DBN, School Name, Total Parent Response Rate, and Total Teacher Reponse Rate are complete with no missing values. 4.2 Dataframe on inclusion and diversity &amp; aggressive behaviors &amp; teaching quality As we can see, for these three dataframes, all variables are complete, except that there are small amount of data missing on Student Response Rate. In all these dataframes, there are only one observation missing on Student Response Rate. As there are a total of 1109 observations in each dataframe, it constitutes a very small percent of missing pattern. 4.3 Dataframe on trust, collaboration, and respect &amp; student performance &amp; family communication As we can see, these three dataframes are complete "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Distribution of School Scores 5.2 Top 10 performance schools 5.3 Dependency Relationships analysis 5.4 Do parents, students and teachers feel the same about teaching quality? 5.5 The relationship between teaching quality and students’ performance 5.6 The relationship between teachers’ trust/collaboration/respect with teaching quality 5.7 The relationship between parents’, students’ and teachers’ feeling about teaching quality", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Distribution of School Scores Before we make any comparison between the NYC schools, we first have a look at the distribution of school scores given from students’, teachers’ and parents’ perspective. In order to do that, we make density plots of the scores faceted by five components (we drop supportive environment score because we know from chapter 4 that it has nearly 100% missing values). We know from the plot that the distribution of school scores in these five aspects are not normally distributed. In fact, they are left-skewed, with long-tail data distributing in the left side of the plot. 5.2 Top 10 performance schools 5.2.1 Top 10 schools in five aspects Firstly, we sort the schools according to the five aforementioned aspects. In this way, we made a leaderboard for top 10 schools with the most collaborative teachers, top 10 schools with the most effective school leadership, top 10 schools with highest trust score, top 10 schools with the most rigid instructions, and top 10 schools with the strongest family-community ties. 5.2.2 Top 10 Schools with the highest comprehensive scores Sometimes it is necessary to evaluate the schools in a more comprehensive way. Therefore, we take all the five aspects into consideration and calculate a comprehensive school performance score by taking the average of all the scores in five aspects. Then we made a leaderboard of the “Best” 10 Schools in NYC. The best 10 schools in NYC are: ## [1] &quot;COMMUNITY SCHOOL FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE&quot; &quot;P.S. 321 WILLIAM PENN&quot; ## [3] &quot;THE BROOKLYN NEW SCHOOL, P.S. 146&quot; &quot;KENNEDY YABC&quot; ## [5] &quot;HELLENIC CLASSICAL CHARTER SCHOOL&quot; &quot;P.S. 253&quot; ## [7] &quot;P.S. 041 CROCHERON&quot; &quot;HS ARTS &amp; BUSINESS YABC&quot; ## [9] &quot;P.S. 065&quot; &quot;P.S. 112 LEFFERTS PARK&quot; As we can read from this graph, some schools, like Community School for Social Justice, HS Arts &amp; Business YABC ranked high in several aspects, thus have a high comprehensive score. There are other schools, like Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics, that ranked high only in particular aspects. 5.3 Dependency Relationships analysis Apart from the scores given by the Department of Education of NYC, we also evaluate the performance of each school from the perspective of students, teachers and parents based on their answers to the questionnaire directly. In this section, we are going to look at the relationship of school scores given from different perspectives. 5.3.1 Do Teachers and Parents feel the same about Family-Community bond? Both teachers and parents have answered some questions about their feelings on the family-community bond in their schools. For example, in the questionnaire for teachers, there are several statements like “teachers understand families’ problems and concerns.” Meanwhile, in the questionnaire for parents, there are statements like “School staff regularly communicate with me about how I can help my child learn.”. Parents and teachers are asked to give the degree in which they agree to such statements, such as “strongly agree”,“agree”,“disagree”,“strongly disagree”,“I don’t know”. In this way, we are able to analyze whether teachers and parents feel the same about the family-community bond in their schools. In order to make our analysis easier, we firstly derive a family-community bond score for each school from parents’ and teachers’ point of view respectively. More specifically, we calculate the percentage of strongly agree,agree,disagree,strongly disagree,idk, and add +2 points for strongly agree, +1 point for agree, -1 point for disagree, -2 points for strongly disagree and +0 point for I don't know. The scores given by teachers and parents are clearly positively correlated: The correlation coefficient is: ## [1] 0.4812162 5.3.2 Do teachers and students feel the same on inclusion at school? Teachers and students have answered some questions about their feelings on inclusion in their schools from their own perspectives. In this way, we are able to analysis whether teachers and students have a consensus on inclusion. In order to make our analysis easier, we firstly calculate a student inclusion score for each school from students’ and teachers’ point of view respectively, using the formula mentioned in 5.3.1. The scores given by students and teachers are also positively correlated: The correlation coefficient is: ## [1] 0.413764 5.3.3 Do teachers and students feel the same about aggressive behaviors? Both teachers and students have answered some questions on aggressive behaviors in their schools. For example, they are asked to rate how frequent such aggressive behaviors happens, with response choices as “none”,“rarely”,“some”,“most”. In this way, we are able to analyze whether teachers and students feel the same about the aggressive behaviors in their schools. In order to make our analysis easier, we firstly derive a score for each school from students’ and teachers’ point of view respectively. More specifically, we calculate the percentage of none,rarely,some,most, and add +2 points for none, +1 point for rarely, -1 point for some, -2 points for most. The scores given by students and teachers are also positively correlated: The correlation coefficient is: ## [1] 0.6765192 5.4 Do parents, students and teachers feel the same about teaching quality? Students, teachers and parents have all answered some questions on teaching quality in their respective schools. Due to inconsistencies in answer choices, we have generalized the response based on degree of positivity(“strongly positive”, “positive”, “negative”, “strongly negative”, “i don’t know”). In this way, we are able to analyze whether parents, teachers and students feel the same about teaching quality. In order to make our analysis easier, we firstly derive a score for each school from students’, parents’ and teachers’ point of view respectively. More specifically, we calculate the percentage of strongly positive,positive,negative,strongly negative, and add +2 points for strongly positive, +1 point for positive, -1 point for negative, -2 points for strongly negative. The relationship between the score given by parents, students and teachers are plotted in the following scatterplot: The score given by teachers and parents are positively correlated. However, the score given by students are negatively correlated with the score given by teachers and parents. Moreover, students tend to give lower scores to their teachers while teachers and parents tend to give higher score to teaching quality. This is reasonable since students might have different ideas with adults about what good education is. They might dislike those teachers who impose stringent disciplines and assign a lot of homework. Additionally there could be subjective bias due to the positions that each of them holds. 5.5 The relationship between teaching quality and students’ performance As we hypothesized, teaching quality would be positively related to students’ performance. Thus, we decided to create a scatter plot and look into the relationship between these two variables. Note that we have calculated the student performance score solely based on teachers’ perspectives, while the teaching quality is assessed by all three perspective (teachers, students, parents) The result support our hypothesis mentioned above. The students’ performance score is positively correlated with the teaching quality score given by teachers and parents, while negatively correlated with the teaching quality score given by students themselves. It’s interesting to find out this negative relationship and made us wonder does students’ attitude toward teachers plays a role in students’ achievement. We have also computed a average teaching quality score based on the feedback from all three perspectives and looked into its relationship with student performance. ## [1] 0.529755 This averaged teaching quality score aligns with our hypothesis, such that teaching quality would be positively related to students’ performance. 5.6 The relationship between teachers’ trust/collaboration/respect with teaching quality In this survey, teachers are also asked several questions about their feelings towards the trust, collaboration and respect between teachers in their schools. We believe that a healthy environment in teacher community is beneficial to the teaching quality. Therefore, in this section we investigate whether this hypothesis is true. From the scatterplot above we notice that the trust, collaboration and respect between teachers are closely correlated with themselves, and are also strongly correlated with the teaching quality scores given by teachers themselves. However, such correlation is weaker for the teaching quality scores given by parents, and is negatively correlated with the teaching quality scores given by students. 5.7 The relationship between parents’, students’ and teachers’ feeling about teaching quality Interested in the diversed opinions on teaching quality, we decided to look into this more by creating a parallel coordinate graph. To make our graph easier to read, we have shorted the labels of the categories: st_v_n: student whose rating is very negative st_n: student whose rating is negative st_p: student whose rating is positive st_v_p: student whose rating is very positive t_v_n: teacher whose rating is very negative t_n: teacher whose rating is negative t_p: student whose rating is positive t_v_p: teacher whose rating is very positive p_v_n: parent whose rating is very negative p_n: parent whose rating is negative p_p: parent whose rating is positive p_v_p: parent whose rating is very positive "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 The relationship between parents’ and teachers’ rating on family-community bonds 6.2 The relationship between students’ and teachers’ rating on inclusion 6.3 The relationship between students’ and teachers’ rating on aggressive behaviors", " Chapter 6 Interactive component For interactive component, we have decided to learn more about the ratings from different perspectives, as we are fascinated by the fact that the dataset is comprised of three perspectives. Through interactive visualizations, besides looking into whether different perspectives have consensus on aspects of education, we have categorized the scores we calculated. For example, for each perspective, scores between -0.5 and 0 is categorized as a group, and 0 and 0.5 are categorized as another group. We have made 8 categories as the scores ranged from -2 to 2, and we hope to have a general idea on the amount of school within the same score range. For all the interactive plots below, you may randomly move your mouse over a point and the name of the school may appear. Additionally, all the red points are schools of similar scores with the school you clicked. Due to the size of our dataset, it is difficult for us to label all the schools with similar scores. However, you may get a clue of the distribution of the score by looking at the area that is labeled red. 6.1 The relationship between parents’ and teachers’ rating on family-community bonds 6.2 The relationship between students’ and teachers’ rating on inclusion 6.3 The relationship between students’ and teachers’ rating on aggressive behaviors "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Result Summary 7.2 Limitations, Future Directions, and Lessons Learned", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Result Summary 7.1.1 Distribution of School Scores The distribution of school scores in five aspects (Collaborative Teachers Score,Effective School Leadership Score,Rigorous Instruction Score,Strong Family-Community Ties Score,Trust Score) are left skewed. 7.1.2 The Best 10 Schools in NYC The best 10 schools evaluated from the aforementioned five aspects are: COMMUNITY SCHOOL FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE P.S. 321 WILLIAM PENN THE BROOKLYN NEW SCHOOL, P.S. 146 KENNEDY YABC HELLENIC CLASSICAL CHARTER SCHOOL P.S. 253 P.S. 041 CROCHERON HS ARTS &amp; BUSINESS YABC P.S. 065 P.S. 112 LEFFERTS PARK 7.1.3 Dependency Relationships Teachers’ and parents’ rating on Family-Community bond is positively correlated, with 0.4812 correlation coefficient. Teachers’ and students’ rating on inclusion and diversity is positively correlated, with 0.4137 correlation coefficient. Teachers’ and students’ rating on aggressive behaviors is positively correlated, with 0.6765 correlation coefficient. Teachers’ and parents’ rating on teaching quality are positively correlated. However, the score given by students about teaching quality is negatively correlated with the score given by teachers and parents. Moreover, students tend to give poor scores to their teachers while teachers and parents tend to give higher score. The students’ performance score is positively correlated with the teaching quality score given by teachers and parents, while negatively correlated with the teaching quality score given by students themselves. The averaged score of teaching quality is positively correlated with student performance Trust, collaboration and respect between teachers are closely correlated themselves, and are also strongly correlated with the teaching quality scores given by teachers themselves. However, such correlation is weaker for the teaching quality scores given by parents, and is negatively correlated with the teaching quality scores given by students. 7.2 Limitations, Future Directions, and Lessons Learned One of our limitations is in the data cleaning process. As we have mentioned in our dating cleaning chapter, the categorization process is highly subjective. We have categorized the survey questions into different aspects based on our understanding. As we do neither have expertise in NYC’s education system nor this area in general, we are open to any suggestions and advice in the categorizing process. Additionally, for analysis purposes, we have designed a scoring system as specified in the visualization chapter. We understand the scoring system may not be objective and accurate. Additionally, the dataset from parents and teacher are much larger than the dataset from students. As we understood that the survey process is completely voluntary, we would like to learn more about why there is a huge gap in the number of participants from parents, students, and teachers. Additionally, gathering more data from students may be beneficial for a more comprehensive understanding of the education status quo. Future directions may include analysis across a time span. As the school survey has been conducted annually, it would be interesting to learn the changes across years. Additionally, future analysis could look into the negative relationship between teachers’ and students’ ratings on teaching quality. In general, we are surprised by the complexity and subjectivity involved in analyzing this dataset in social sciences. We both gained more experience in analyzing education datasets, and the procedure of conducting this project is a nice review for the analysis and visualizations skills we have learned thus far.
