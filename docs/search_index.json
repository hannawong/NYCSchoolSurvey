The survey ranks among the largest surveys of any kind ever conducted nationally. The NYC School Survey consists of three separate survey instruments: The “parent/guardian survey”, the “teacher survey”, and the “student survey” (for students in grades 6 – 12 only). To review 2021 NYC School Survey instruments, see the links below: https://infohub.nyced.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/student-instrument_08312021_accessible.pdf https://infohub.nyced.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/family-instrument_083121_accessible.pdf https://infohub.nyced.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/teacher-instrument_aug-2021_accessible.pdf Survey questions assess the community’s opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect. Survey results provide insight into a school’s learning environment and contribute a measure of diversification that goes beyond test scores on the Progress Report. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school’s strengths and target areas for improvement. The NYC School Quality Reports includes six elements – Rigorous Instruction, Collaborative Teachers, Supportive Environment, Effective School Leadership, Strong Family Community Ties, and Trust. The meanings of these six elements are illustrated in Chapter 2. 1.2 Our goal in this project In this project, we will take a look at the NYC School Quality Reports that reflect the opinion of parents, teachers and students, and answer the questions listed below: What are the top 10 schools with the highest survey performance? What are their characteristics? What is the distribution of performance over the six components (Collaborative Teachers Score, Effective School Leadership Score, Rigorous Instruction Score, Supportive Environment Score, Strong Family Community Ties Score, Trust Score)? What does it imply? How do parents, teachers, and students rate the education experience respectively? Do teachers and students have a consensus on their survey scores? And what about the relationship between students’ and parents’ responses? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Data source links 2.2 A glimpse at our dataset", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Data source links The result of parent, teacher and student response of the NYC school survey can be found in the links listed below: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2019-NYC-School-Survey-Teachers/uzmq-2khh https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2019-NYC-School-Survey-Parents/4fcz-jias https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2019-NYC-School-Survey-Student/k2zg-756q We download the dataset as xlsx format from the aforementioned websites. 2.2 A glimpse at our dataset 2.2.1 Dataframe on Aggregated Data The survey contains a aggregated dataframe in which scores evaluating different dimensions of school performance are calculated based on students, teachers, and parents’ responses. 2.2.1.1 Meanings of columns Before we start to perform any exploratory data analysis and visualization , we need to understand what does each column mean in our dataset. The three dataframes we mentioned above – Student, Teacher and Parent survey result – contains 11 columns: DBN: a character code used to identify a school and its location. It is formed by concatenating the school district code, the school borough code, and the school number. School Name: School Name Total Parent/Teacher/Student Response Rate: Percentage rate of parent/teacher/student response. The response rate should be the same in three datasets. Collaborative Teachers Score: This element reflects how well teachers participate in opportunities to develop, grow, and contribute to the continuous improvement of the school community. This section uses data from the Quality Review and the NYC School Survey. Effective School Leadership Score: This element reflects how well school leadership inspires the school community with a clear instructional vision and effectively distributes leadership to realize this vision. This section uses data from the Quality Review and the NYC School Survey. Rigorous Instruction Score: This element reflects how well the curriculum and instruction engage students and build critical-thinking skills. This section uses NYC Department of Education data from the Quality Review and the NYC School Survey. Supportive Environment Score: This element reflects how well the school establishes a culture where students feel safe, challenged to grow, and supported to meet high expectations. This section uses data from the Quality Review, the NYC School Survey, the percentage of students with attendance rates of 90% or higher, and movement of students with disabilities to less restrictive environments. Strong Family-Community Ties Score: This element reflects how well the school forms effective partnerships with families to improve the school. This section uses data from the Quality Review and the NYC School Survey. Trust Score: This element reflects whether the relationships between administrators, educators, students, and families are based on trust and respect. This section uses data from the NYC School Survey. Despite the aggregated dataframe should be exactly the same for all three datasets, it is different within each dataset The exact information on this dataframe from each dataset is displayed below. In summary, we concluded that the aggregated dataframe of teacher and parents’ consists of DBNs where evaluation scores are completely void. Thus, we decide to look into the aggregated dataframe provided in the student response dataset. 2.2.1.2 Student Reponse dataset The student response result is a dataframe with 1831 observations and 11 columns. As the first two rows of the dataframe is completely empty, the dataset actually consists of 1829 observations. Some important information are shown below: ## tibble [1,831 × 11] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ DBN : chr [1:1831] NA NA &quot;01M015&quot; &quot;01M019&quot; ... ## $ School Name : chr [1:1831] NA NA &quot;P.S. 015 ROBERTO CLEMENTE&quot; &quot;P.S. 019 ASHER LEVY&quot; ... ## $ Total Parent ## Response Rate : num [1:1831] NA NA 91 100 58 29 80 52 79 46 ... ## $ Total Teacher Response Rate : num [1:1831] NA NA 100 93 90 100 100 96 77 93 ... ## $ Total Student Response Rate : chr [1:1831] NA NA &quot;N/A&quot; &quot;N/A&quot; ... ## $ Collaborative Teachers Score : chr [1:1831] NA NA &quot;4.0999999999999996&quot; &quot;4.53&quot; ... ## $ Effective School Leadership Score : chr [1:1831] NA NA &quot;4.1900000000000004&quot; &quot;4.51&quot; ... ## $ Rigorous Instruction Score : chr [1:1831] NA NA &quot;4.0199999999999996&quot; &quot;4.8&quot; ... ## $ Supportive Environment Score : chr [1:1831] NA NA &quot;N/A&quot; &quot;N/A&quot; ... ## $ Strong Family-Community Ties Score: chr [1:1831] NA NA &quot;4.18&quot; &quot;4.66&quot; ... ## $ Trust Score : chr [1:1831] NA NA &quot;3.96&quot; &quot;3.76&quot; ... 2.2.1.3 Teacher Reponse dataset Similarly, the teacher response result is a dataframe of 1,903 observations and 11 columns.

Currently, each dataframe has questions as the column name, while the answers falls into the first row. Additionally, as each question may take up to five or 6 columns, there are hundreds of variables within each dataframe. Thus, after data cleaning, we have made choices to focus on some specific questions within each dataframe. 2.2.2.1 Student Reponse dataset Student Reponse dataset is a dataframe of 1,111 observations and 272 columns.

The column names of the aggregated datafrome after transformation is: 3.2 Step 2: Transform survey response from student, teacher, and parents. The original dataframe contains survey questions as the column names. After loading the data in r, the answer choices is read as values in the first row. Thus, we have combined the answer choices within the column name for data wrangling and for the uniequeness of column names. Additionally, for the convenience of data wrangling, we have replaced the survey questions to question index in the column names. Additionally, the data types of many columns are incorrect – instead of character, they should be float. Therefore, we convert the data type of those columns to numeric.

After reading through our survey questions, based on the survey questions, we have decided to categorize the data into different categories, and choose to analyze several categories based on our interests and whether there is sufficient data support. We realized that categorizing data based on survey questions could be highly objective and admit it as a limitation. We are open to any discussions and advice on categorizing survey questions. Several questions are directly removed during the categorizing process. We have removed question 3, 4b, 4h, 14, 15, 16, 24, 25 from the teacher’s survey either because it’s not particularly relevant to survey questions from students’ and parents’ perspective, or due to significant amount of NAs. Questions 5d, 5e, 7, 8, 9, 10 are removed from the parents datasets due to similar reasons or because some questions are tageted to specific populations (eg. pre-k, high school) After discussion, here are some example of the aspects we have decided to look into are teaching quality (from all perspectives of students, parents, and teachers), student performance (based on the feedback of teachers), communication between school and family (mainly based on the response from parents and teachers), and lastly, we’ll look into the characteristics that may contribute to teaching quality, for example, trust and respect between teachers. 3.4 Datasets that we decide to analyze Note that some answer choice are renamed due to inconsistencies between questions. Additionally, some questions are deleted due to the same reason. 3.4.1 Communication with families from teachers’ and parents’ perspectives ## # A tibble: 6 × 13 ## DBN `School Name` teacher_rr t_s_disagree t_s_agree t_agree t_disagree ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 01M015 P.S. 015 ROBERTO … 100 1 85 235 2 ## 2 01M019 P.S. 019 ASHER LE… 93 2 95 284 7 ## 3 01M020 P.S. 020 ANNA SIL… 90 1 79 270 10 ## 4 01M034 P.S. 034 FRANKLIN… 100 10 83 275 41 ## 5 01M063 THE STAR ACADEMY … 100 0 65 190 6 ## 6 01M064 P.S. 064 ROBERT S… 96 2 83 205 9 ## # … with 6 more variables: parent_rr &lt;dbl&gt;, p_s_disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # p_s_agree &lt;dbl&gt;, p_agree &lt;dbl&gt;, p_disagree &lt;dbl&gt;, p_idk &lt;dbl&gt; 3.4.2 Teaching quality and student performance ## # A tibble: 6 × 19 ## DBN `School Name` parent_rr p_v_neagtive p_negative p_positive p_v_positive ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 01M034 P.S. 034 FRA… 29 1 5 130 59 ## 2 01M140 P.S. 140 NAT… 57 5 16 331 174 ## 3 01M184 P.S. 184M SH… 92 5 50 928 385 ## 4 01M188 P.S. 188 THE… 99 2 3 513 198 ## 5 01M292 ORCHARD COLL… 49 6 10 163 71 ## 6 01M332 UNIVERSITY N… 76 4 23 285 124 ## # … with 12 more variables: p_idk &lt;dbl&gt;, teacher_rr &lt;dbl&gt;, t_NAs &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # t_v_negative &lt;dbl&gt;, t_v_positive &lt;dbl&gt;, t_positive &lt;dbl&gt;, t_negative &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # student_rr &lt;dbl&gt;, st_v_negative &lt;dbl&gt;, st_v_positive &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # st_positive &lt;dbl&gt;, st_negative &lt;dbl&gt; ## # A tibble: 6 × 8 ## DBN `School Name` teacher_rr t_none t_some t_lot t_all t_idk ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 01M015 P.S. 015 ROBERTO CLEMENTE 100 5 87 150 66 0 ## 2 01M019 P.S. 019 ASHER LEVY 93 2 112 212 89 0 ## 3 01M020 P.S. 020 ANNA SILVER 90 18 150 222 26 2 ## 4 01M034 P.S. 034 FRANKLIN D.

There is no complete cases in this dataset as we know that one variable is completely void. However, more than 1/2 of the data only have the ‘Supportive Environment Score’ missing. Besides ‘Supportive Environment Score’, ‘Total Student Response Rate’ has the second most NAs. As we can observe from this graph, these are the two most common cases of the dataset, around 80% to 90% of the data lies in this category. This dataset does not contains complete cases, which means for certain observations all variables do not contain NAs. However, we can see that the columns ‘DBN’, ‘School Name’, ‘Total Parent Response Rate’, and ‘Total Teacher Reponse Rate’ are complete with no missing values. 4.2 Dataframe on inclusion and diversity &amp; aggressive behaviors &amp; teaching quality As we can see, for these three dataframes, all variables are complete, except that there are small amount of data missing on Student Response Rate 4.3 Dataframe on trust, collaboration, and respect &amp; student performance &amp; family communication As we can see, these three dataframes are complete "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Distribution of Five Components", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Distribution of Five Components Before we make any comparison between NYC schools, we firstly have a look at the distribution of our dataset, i.e. the distribution of five components from students’, teachers’ and parents’ perspective (we drop supportive environment score because we know from chapter 4 that it has more than 50% missing values). 5.1.1 Density Plots Firstly, we make density plots of the scores faceted by these five components for student, teacher and parent respectively. ## # A tibble: 9,145 × 7 ## DBN name parent_rr teacher_rr student_rr aspect score ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 01M015 P.S. 015 ROBERTO CLEMENTE 91 100 NA p_col… 4.1 ## 2 01M015 P.S. 015 ROBERTO CLEMENTE 91 100 NA p_eff… 4.19 ## 3 01M015 P.S. 015 ROBERTO CLEMENTE 91 100 NA p_rig… 4.02 ## 4 01M015 P.S. 015 ROBERTO CLEMENTE 91 100 NA p_fam… 4.18 ## 5 01M015 P.S. 015 ROBERTO CLEMENTE 91 100 NA p_tru… 3.96 ## 6 01M019 P.S. 019 ASHER LEVY 100 93 NA p_col… 4.53 ## 7 01M019 P.S. 019 ASHER LEVY 100 93 NA p_eff… 4.51 ## 8 01M019 P.S. 019 ASHER LEVY 100 93 NA p_rig… 4.8 ## 9 01M019 P.S. 019 ASHER LEVY 100 93 NA p_fam… 4.66 ## 10 01M019 P.S. 019 ASHER LEVY 100 93 NA p_tru… 3.76 ## # … with 9,135 more rows ## # A tibble: 9,145 × 7 ## DBN name parent_rr teacher_rr student_rr aspect score ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 01M015 P.S. 015 ROBERTO CLEMENTE 91 100 NA s_col… 4.1 ## 2 01M015 P.S. 015 ROBERTO CLEMENTE 91 100 NA s_eff… 4.19 ## 3 01M015 P.S. 015 ROBERTO CLEMENTE 91 100 NA s_rig… 4.02 ## 4 01M015 P.S. 015 ROBERTO CLEMENTE 91 100 NA s_fam… 4.18 ## 5 01M015 P.S. 015 ROBERTO CLEMENTE 91 100 NA s_tru… 3.96 ## 6 01M019 P.S. 019 ASHER LEVY 100 93 NA s_col… 4.53 ## 7 01M019 P.S. 019 ASHER LEVY 100 93 NA s_eff… 4.51 ## 8 01M019 P.S. 019 ASHER LEVY 100 93 NA s_rig… 4.8 ## 9 01M019 P.S. 019 ASHER LEVY 100 93 NA s_fam… 4.66 ## 10 01M019 P.S. 019 ASHER LEVY 100 93 NA s_tru… 3.76 ## # … with 9,135 more rows "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
