There is no complete cases in this dataset as we know that one variable is completely void. However, more than 1/3 of the data only have the ‘Supportive Environment Score’ missing. Besides ‘Supportive Environment Score’, ‘Total Student Response Rate’ has the second most NAs. As we can observe from this graph, these are the two most common cases of the dataset, around 80% to 90% of the data lies in this category. This dataset does not contains complete cases, which means for certain observations all variables do not tontain NAs. However, we can see that the columns ‘DBN’, ‘School Name’, Total Parent Response Rate, and ‘Total Teacher Reponse Rate’ are complete with no missing values.
