The survey ranks among the largest surveys of any kind ever conducted nationally. The NYC School Survey consists of three separate survey instruments: The “parent/guardian survey”, the “teacher survey”, and the “student survey” (for students in grades 6 – 12 only). To review 2021 NYC School Survey instruments, see the links below: https://infohub.nyced.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/student-instrument_08312021_accessible.pdf https://infohub.nyced.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/family-instrument_083121_accessible.pdf https://infohub.nyced.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/teacher-instrument_aug-2021_accessible.pdf Survey questions assess the community’s opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect. Survey results provide insight into a school’s learning environment and contribute a measure of diversification that goes beyond test scores on the Progress Report. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school’s strengths and target areas for improvement. The NYC School Quality Reports includes six elements – Rigorous Instruction, Collaborative Teachers, Supportive Environment, Effective School Leadership, Strong Family Community Ties, and Trust. The meanings of these six elements are illustrated in Chapter 2. 1.0.2 Our goal in this project In this project, we will take a look at the NYC School Quality Reports that reflect the opinion of parents, teachers and students, and answer the questions listed below: What are the top 10 schools with the highest survey performance? What are their characteristics? What is the distribution of performance over the six components (Collaborative Teachers Score, Effective School Leadership Score, Rigorous Instruction Score, Supportive Environment Score, Strong Family Community Ties Score, Trust Score)? What does it imply? How do parents, teachers, and students rate the education experience respectively? Do teachers and students have a consensus on their survey scores? And what about the relationship between students’ and parents’ responses? "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
