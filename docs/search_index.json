In order to do that, we make density plots of the scores faceted by five components (we drop supportive environment score because we know from chapter 4 that it has nearly 100% missing values). We know from the plot that the distribution of school scores in these five aspects are not normally distributed, in fact, they are left-skewed, with long-tail data distributing in the left side of the plot. 5.2 Top 10 performance schools 5.2.1 Top 10 schools in five aspects Firstly, we sort the schools according to the five aforementioned aspects. In this way, we made a leaderboard for Top 10 Schools with the most collaborative teachers, Top 10 Schools with the most effective School Leadership, Top 10 Schools with the most Trust beween people, Top 10 Schools with the most rigid instructions, and Top 10 Schools with the Strongest Family Community Ties. 5.2.2 Top 10 Schools with the highest comprehensive scores Sometimes it is necessary to evaluate the schools in a more comprehensive way. Therefore, we take all the five aspects into consideration and calculate a comprehensive school performance score by taking the average of all the scores in five aspects. Then we made a leaderboard of the “Best” 10 Schools in NYC. The best 10 schools in NYC are: ## [1] &quot;COMMUNITY SCHOOL FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE&quot; &quot;P.S. 321 WILLIAM PENN&quot; ## [3] &quot;THE BROOKLYN NEW SCHOOL, P.S. 146&quot; &quot;KENNEDY YABC&quot; ## [5] &quot;HELLENIC CLASSICAL CHARTER SCHOOL&quot; &quot;P.S. 253&quot; ## [7] &quot;P.S. 041 CROCHERON&quot; &quot;HS ARTS &amp; BUSINESS YABC&quot; ## [9] &quot;P.S. 065&quot; &quot;P.S. 112 LEFFERTS PARK&quot; 5.3 Dependency Relationships analysis Apart from the scores given by Department of Education of NYC, we also evaluate the performance of each school from the perspective of students, teachers and parents according to their answers to the questionnaire directly. In this section, we are going to look at the relationship of school scores given from different perspectives. 5.3.1 Do Teachers and Parents feel the same about Family-Community bond? Both teachers and parents have answered some questions about their feelings about the family-community bond in their schools. For example, in the questionnaire for teachers, there are several statements like “teachers understand families’ problems and concerns.”. Meanwhile, in the questionnaire for parents, there are statements like “School staff regularly communicate with me about how I can help my child learn.”. Parents and teachers are asked to give the degree in which they agree to such statements, such as “strongly agree”,“agree”,“disagree”,“strongly disagree”,“I don’t know”. In this way, we are able to analysis whether teachers and parents feel the same about the family-community bond in their schools. In order to make our analysis easier, we firstly derive a family-community bond score for each school from parents’ and teachers’ point of view respectively. More specifically, we calculate the percentage of strongly agree,agree,disagree,strongly disagree,idk, and add +2 points for strongly agree, +1 point for agree, -1 point for disagree, -2 points for strongly disagree and +0 point for I don't know. The scores given by teachers and parents are clearly positively correlated: The correlation coefficient is: ## [1] 0.4812162 5.3.2 Do teachers and students feel the same about student inclusion? Teachers and students have answered some questions about their feelings towards the student inclusion in their schools from their own perspectives. In this way, we are able to analysis whether teachers and students feel the same about student inclusion. In order to make our analysis easier, we firstly calculate a student inclusion score for each school from students’ and teachers’ point of view respectively, using the formula mentioned in 5.3.1. The scores given by students and teachers are also positively correlated: The correlation coefficient is: ## [1] 0.413764 5.3.3 Do teachers and students feel the same about aggressive behaviors? Both teachers and parents have answered some questions about their feelings about the aggressive behaviors in their schools. The are asked to reply how frequent such aggressive behaviors happens, such as “none”,“rarely”,“some”,“most”. In this way, we are able to analysis whether teachers and students feel the same about the aggressive behaviors in their schools. In order to make our analysis easier, we firstly derive a score for each school from parents’ and teachers’ point of view respectively. More specifically, we calculate the percentage of none,rarely,some,most, and add +2 points for none, +1 point for rarely, -1 point for some, -2 points for most. The scores given by students and teachers are also positively correlated: The correlation coefficient is: ## [1] 0.6765192 5.4 Do parents, students and teachers feel the same about teaching quality? Students, teachers and parents have answered some questions about their feelings about the teaching quality in their schools. The are asked to reply to which degree they believe that the teachers demonstrate good teaching qualities, such as “strongly positive”,“positive”,“negative”,“strongly negative”,“i don’t know”. In this way, we are able to analysis whether parents, teachers and students feel the same about teaching quality. In order to make our analysis easier, we firstly derive a score for each school from students’, parents’ and teachers’ point of view respectively. More specifically, we calculate the percentage of strongly positive,positive,negative,strongly negative, and add +2 points for strongly positive, +1 point for positive, -1 point for negative, -2 points for strongly negative. The relationship between the score given by parents, students and teachers are plotted in the following scatterplot: The score given by teachers and parents are positively correlated, however, the score given by students are negatively correlated with the score given by teachers and parents. Moreover, students tend to give poor scores to their teachers while teachers and parents tend to give higher score to teaching quality. This is reasonable since students might have different ideas with adults about what good education is. They might dislike those teachers who impose stringent disciplines and assign a lot of homework, however, it is the rules and strict teaching methods that makes them achieve success in academic field. In order to prove this hypothesis, we then investigate into the relationship between teaching quality and students’ performance. 5.5 The relationship between teaching quality and students’ performance The result support our hypothesis mentioned above. The students’ performance score is positively correlated with the teaching quality score given by teachers and parents, while negatively correlated with the teaching quality score given by students themselves. Therefore, students do achieve better despite that they do not like their teachers. 5.6 The relationship between teachers’ trust/collaboration/respect with teaching quality In this survey, teachers are also asked several questions about their feelings towards the trust, collaboration and respect between teachers in their schools. We believe that a healthy environment in teacher community is beneficial to the teaching quality. Therefore, in this section we investigate whether this hypothesis is true. From the scatterplot above we notice that the trust, collaboration and respect between teachers are closely correlated themselves, and are also strongly correlated with the teaching quality scores given by teachers themselves. However, such correlation is weaker for the teaching quality scores given by parents, and is negatively correlated with the teaching quality scores given by students.
